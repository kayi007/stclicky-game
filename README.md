Explore your memory with your favorite characters! <br> 
Don't click on the same picture twice!

## Game Rules
- 12 pictures of Stranger Things characters wil appear in a random order on the screen
- Click on any one of them to start the game 
- The pictures will reshuffle after every click (the whole point of testing your memory, right?)
- Don't click on the one you've just clicked, or else you lose the game instantly (don't worry, your memory can't be THAT bad. you're just not familiar with the game during the first few rounds)
- Continue to click on the ones you have NOT clicked until you've clicked on all of them <br>
**(REMEMBER: Don't click on the same picture twice!)**
